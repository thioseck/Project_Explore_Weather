# Project- Explore Weather Trends 

# Thioro Fall

# GOAL
 The Goal of the project was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences 
 between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where we live.

# INSTRUCTIONS
+ Extract the data from the database.
+ Need to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where we live.
  Can find a list of cities and countries in the city_list table.
+ To interact with the database, need to write a SQL query.
+ Open up the CSV in Excel.
+ Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures.
+ Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
+ Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages temprature.
+ Answer questions such as:
 + Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
 + How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?
 + What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? 
 + Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?

# TOOLS USED 
 
  1. SQL: to extract the data from the database
  2. Python: to calculate the moving average and plotting line chart 
  3. Anaconda- Jupiter Note book: to write python code and make observations
